# A game of hangman

While this may look like a normal game of hangman what I really call this is: a project with "scope creep."

All we were simply asked to do was make a game of hangman using the words.json file and be able to play it. However, upon completing that task, I found myself continuing to want to add more and more features. For example, what if I wanted to enter the word myself? What if I wanted to play on hard mode and not use vowels? What about playing with two people and someone else entered a word?

Luckily, at this point in my life, I have the extra couple hours in my days to spend more time on a game like this and develop it into something even more fun!
